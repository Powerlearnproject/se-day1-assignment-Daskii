#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the discipline of using an engineering process of principles, methods and relevant tools to develop and maintain high-quality software. 
It plays a crucial role in the tech industry by enabling creation  of software applications and systems that are mostly used in our everday lives including communication, entertainment and commerce.  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Software enginnering has evolved gradually over the years with innovation such as :
1. Development of programming languages - One of the first languages discovered/developed in the 1950s by IBM was Fortan(Formula Translation), a high level genral purpose language which had functional  implementation as oppossed to odd paper design.
2. Software engineering as a discipline - During the 60s and 70s that is where Software Engineering took shape where practitioners and researchers developed formal methods of programming including Structured programming and use of flowcharts.
3. Agile Methodology - in the late 90s a group of practitioners questioned the effectivness of traditional methods, leading to significant change in approach, value, collaboration and customer prioritizing, the born/rise of Agile methods.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Problem Definiton : Identifying the problem, determining the cause and outline a strategy for solving the problem E.g Problem Statement.
2. Analysis : Determining what must be done to solve the problem, this is where the developers, an analyst and the USER works together to develop a logical model identifying essential processes, data elements and the likes.
3. Design : How the problem will be solved, Identifying the primary physical components and the interfaces that link with them.
4. Development : Programs are coded, debugged, documented and testing may commence. Steps/Procedures are written for end-users.
5. Testing : Testing begins with module tests, then components and finally a system test. This step ensures that the system meets user's needs.
6. Implementaion : After testing, the system is then released to the user to review and approve.
7. Maintenance : After it's released, support begins, to keep the system functioning properly and ensure user satisfaction.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile is a repetitve approach for building software and applications while Waterfall is a sequential approach that includes some phases each covering a seperate part of development.
In Agile, user input is required throught the development while in Waterfall user input is required only after each phase.
Agile is used in large scales while Waterfall is mostly for smaller scales projects.
Less costs in Agile, high costs in Waterfall.
Less completion time in Agile, Requires more time in Waterfall.
The Agile is known for its flexibility while Waterfall is more rigid.

Unlike Agile, Waterfall best suits projects that are well defined within the scope, requirements, complexity and a difinitive timeline with no significant changes whereas Agile best suits projects that require frequent feedback loops, tight budgets and additionally when teams need to collaborate intensivley such as in different areas/locations.




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer : Responsible for write code and software implementation.
Quality Assurance Eng : Verifies software quality by designing and testing software.
Porject Manager : Oversees planning, execution and delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

These are tools used by developers to enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality with features such as code editors, version control, debugging and automated testing capabilities. Eg, Visual Studio code is a IDE and GIT is a version control.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Requirements change : change in requirements during the SDLC may lead to scope creep and delay of implementation.
Tight Deadlines : Pressure to deliver software products can result in rushed development compromising software quality.
Technical Debt : Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Effective and clear communication, agile methods, task prioritizing and regular re-assessment of timelines are strategies to overcome the challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing : Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing : Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing : Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing : Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Quality Control: measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is a starting point used to generate natural langauge proceesing response from a language AI Model.
Prompt engineering is important as it helps avoids human errors or rectifies the mistake and returns a valid output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

What is a prompt ? > What is a prompt in machine learning ?

Giving context is more concise and clear allowing the machine to return a valid and relavant response to your initial text.
